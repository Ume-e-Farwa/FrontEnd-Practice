FrontEnd-Practice
This repository contains a collection of small frontend projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is crafted to help me enhance my skills in:

UI/UX design

Layout structuring

Responsive design

DOM manipulation

These projects are ideal for practicing and reinforcing core web development concepts, and they serve as a hands-on journey through modern frontend development.
